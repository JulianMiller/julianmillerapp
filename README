== JulianMillerApp

This is my first post-tutorials venture. I was working with someone to prototype a first version of an application which had some very basic "daily deal" functionality. I'm proud of it because even being as inexperienced as I am, I was able to prove to myself that I could build something. It's far from finished but every time I go to http://julianmillerapp.heroku.com/deals/1 I'm reminded that so much more is possible.
